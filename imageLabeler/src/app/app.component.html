<h2 id="overviewID"> 3D Volume Labeling Tool</h2>
<h2> Purpose</h2>
This web application showcases my interests in visualization using vtk.js.
In my previous role as a software developer, I used vtk.js to develop web-based applications for
displaying fMRI imaging data.
I was pleasantly surprised by the speed at which we could build our web application with vtk.js.
<p>
  This visualization app is a prototype for labeling regions of a MRI scan that I built in about 3 weeks.
<p>
  A more mature desktop application of the same nature is the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/">VTK Slicer</a> desktop application.
  I am looking at the human interface options for manual or semi-automatic segmentation.
</p>
<h2> Technologies </h2>
This visualization app leans heavily on
<a href="https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/docs/index.html">vtk.js</a> which provides the volume rendering
and 3D reslicing visualizations.
<p>
  The UI uses <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a> for the overall user interface along with
  <a href="https://material.angular.io/"> Angular Materials </a> as well as
  <a href="https://rxjs.dev/">RxJS</a> for the overall integration of the User Interface.
<p>
  The server is NodeJS using the DICOM parser npm package <code>dicom-parser</code>.
  The server uses  <a href="https://koajs.com/">Koa</a> and it's router, body-parser, and static add-ons.

<p> Follow the 'How to Use' steps below.</p>

  How to Use
</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Select an exam (either Exam 008 or Exam 25. by clicking on the "Exam" button.</li>
  <li>Select a series under the exam  just selected by clicking one of the numerical items.</li>
  <li> Wait for the 'Loading Status' progress to show all slices are loaded.  I am using a budget server, and the data is about 0.9 Gigs for
    a typical dataset.  Once loaded, the 2 viewports appear with images.</li>
  <li> Adjust the view around some area of interest to trace in the left viewport.
    After the mouse release, the drawn region appears in the volume rendering.
  </li>
  <li>
    Start drawing by selecting <code>DRAW</code> and drag the mouse around the region of interest, filling in the
    region.  Then move to the next slice by using the scroll wheel.
    Continue through the stack of slices.
    You can switch to the <code>ERASE</code> mode to erase some unwanted drawn region.
  </li>
  <li>Adjust the global reference volume rendering to gain a feel for the relative region from a more 3D perspective.
    In the global region, mouse drag will rotate the view.  The scroll wheel will perform the zoom adjustment.
    The pan requires holding the shift key while dragging the mouse.</li>
